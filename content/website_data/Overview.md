# Course Overview

This course is part of module SOEE5010: Research Methods, a masters level module for Sustainability MSc students 
in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. The module covers both quantitative and qualitative 
methods over two semesters. This course is the statistics element of the quantitative part of the module, taught using 
Python.

## Objectives
This course contributes to a number of the broader objectives of the module. By the end of it, students should
understand the use of relevant statistical methods to answer research questions with quantitative data. They 
should have the skill to apply these methods, using the Python programming language, to their dissertation projects.
