---

---

**IMPORTANT** This workshop is homework to be completed *before the first computer lab workshop*. It introduces the basic tools we will use in the module: Python and the Jupyter notebook system. 

Students should work through this before the first scheduled computer lab workshop to familiarise themselves with the basics of Python and Jupyter notebook, and refer back to the notes throughout the following workshops.
